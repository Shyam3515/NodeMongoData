=>Great question! Let’s clarify how the data is sent and saved in the MongoDB database with the line const newData = new Data(newObj);.
Data Creation with Mongoose Schema
The Data in new Data(newObj) refers to the Mongoose model. You defined the Data model when you created the schema for your collection:

const Data = mongoose.model('Data', dataSchema);
This model represents a collection in your MongoDB database (in this case, the data collection), and it uses the schema you defined for validation and structure.

new Data(newObj)
=>new Data(newObj) creates a new document based on the Data model and the provided newObj. The newObj is the object containing the data you want to insert into the database. For example, if newObj is { id: 1, name: "Jane", age: 29, occupation: "Architect" }, the new Data(newObj) will create a new instance of a MongoDB document with these properties.

const newData = new Data(newObj);
This step prepares the data to be inserted but does not yet save it to the database.

Saving Data to MongoDB

Once you have created an instance of the data (newData), you need to save it to MongoDB. You do this by calling .save() on the newly created newData object.

await newData.save();
This command does the following:
Sends the data (in this case, the newObj data) to the MongoDB server.
Saves it in the collection (the collection name is based on the model, which is data in this case).
Performs validation based on the schema before saving. If the data doesn’t meet the schema requirements, it throws an error.
Visualizing the Process
Let’s go through the whole process with an example:

Example Data

const newObj = { id: 1, name: "Jane", age: 29, occupation: "Architect" };
Step-by-Step Process
Create the document:

const newData = new Data(newObj);
newData now holds a document object based on the Data model, but this object is only in memory. It hasn't been saved in the MongoDB database yet.
Save the document to the database:

await newData.save();
When you call save(), Mongoose will:
Send the document to MongoDB.
Insert the document into the collection named data in the MongoDB database.
MongoDB will store the document and assign it an \_id field (if not already provided), which uniquely identifies the document in the database.
Full createData Example:

async function createData(newObj) {
try {
// Step 1: Check if a document with the same 'id' already exists
const exists = await Data.findOne({ id: newObj.id });

    // Step 2: If it doesn't exist, create the new document
    if (!exists) {
      // Create the document in memory
      const newData = new Data(newObj);

      // Save the document to MongoDB
      await newData.save();
      console.log('Data created:', newObj);
    } else {
      // If a duplicate is found, log it
      console.log('Duplicate id found:', newObj.id);
    }

} catch (error) {
// Handle any errors during the process
console.error('Error creating data:', error);
}
}
How MongoDB Stores Data
After calling .save(), the MongoDB database stores the data as a document. For example, if the newObj is:

{ id: 1, name: "Jane", age: 29, occupation: "Architect" }
MongoDB will store this as a document inside the data collection in your mydatabase database, like this:

json
Copy code
{
"\_id": ObjectId("someUniqueID"),
"id": 1,
"name": "Jane",
"age": 29,
"occupation": "Architect"
}
\_id: MongoDB automatically generates a unique identifier for each document unless you specify it.
The rest of the fields (id, name, age, occupation) are the data you provided.

Summary
new Data(newObj): This creates a new Mongoose document instance in memory.
.save(): This sends the document to MongoDB and saves it in the corresponding collection.
This process allows you to programmatically add data to MongoDB while ensuring it adheres to the schema you’ve defined.
